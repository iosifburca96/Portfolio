                <p>As a computer science student with a passion for software development, I bring a strong technical background and a deep curiosity for learning. 
                Currently, I am working as a Technical IT at Bosch, where I am using my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, ASP.NET to aid in the software development processes.
                During my previous internship at Halcyon Mobile, I gained valuable experience in Android development using Kotlin and Android Studio, as well as working with GitLab and agile methodologies.
                In addition to my technical abilities, I have a logical mind and enjoy reading books, exploring topics like self-development, history, psychology, and taking walks in nature.
                As a logical thinker with a strong technical background, I am always seeking opportunities to further my knowledge and skills. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am currently learning ReactJS and NodeJS.</p>
